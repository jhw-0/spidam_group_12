= Agile User Stories
- *Epic 1*: As a user of SPIDAM, I want a program written for my purposes so that I can remain focused on my expertise.
  - *User story 1*: As a user of SPIDAM, I want to be able to analyze my data without needing to write nor understand Python libraries and code, so that I can focus on my job and not the tools beneath it.
  - *User story 2*: As a user of SPIDAM, I want an intuitive user interface, so that I can maintain my focus on analyzing acoustic data rather than experimenting or browsing documentation.
  - *User story 3*: As a user of SPIDAM, I want a well-tested program, so that a faulty analysis doesn't cause downstream issues.
- *Epic 2*: As a developer of SPIDAM, I want to focus on development tasks so that I can use my limited time to develop a better product.
  - *User story 1*: As a developer of SPIDAM, I want to be able to come back to my code and understand it, so that I spend as much time as possible writing code.
  - *User story 2*: As a developer of SPIDAM, I want to be able to hand off tasks and quickly on-board new maintainers so that the development of SPIDAM can leverage a team effort to get more done.
  - *User story 3*: As a developer of SPIDAM, I want expressive and robust units of code, so that I have the ability to quickly test, add new features, and reproduce results without spending time rewriting foundational code.

= Results

The audio was recorded in the "Aula Magna" room. \
// (Image goes here.)
// need to show screenshots of all plots, tables, etc. w/ labels

// should be done by the night of the second to final day

= Final Product Testing

// wait until the last day to do this
