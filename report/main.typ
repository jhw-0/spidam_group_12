= Agile User Stories
- *Epic 1*: As a user of the software...
  - *User story 1*: As a user of the software, I want to be able to analyze my data without writing and understanding Python libraries and code so that I can focus on my job and not on the tools beneath it.
  - *User story 2*: As a user of the software, I want to be able to use the software intuitively, without needing to look up documentation, so that I can maintain my focus on analyzing the audio data.
  - *User story 3*: As a user of the software, I want a useful data analysis of my audio files with options built in so that I can get a quick analysis of my data, but have the flexibility to analyze it in many useful ways.
- *Epic 2*: As a maintainer of the software...
  - *User story 1*: As a maintainer of the software, I want to be able to come back to my code and understand it so that I don't spend time on-the-job not writing lines of code.
  - *User story 2*: As a maintainer of the software, I want to be able to hand off tasks and quickly on-board new maintainers so that the software is not totally reliant on me.
  - *User story 3*: As a maintainer of the software, I want the ability to quickly test, add new features, and reproduce results so that I can focus on adding new features, rather than fixing old problems.

= Results

The audio was recorded in the "Aula Magna" room. \
// (Image goes here.)
// need to show screenshots of all plots, tables, etc. w/ labels

// should be done by the night of the second to final day

= Final Product Testing

// wait until the last day to do this
